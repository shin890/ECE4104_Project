Project Name: Peformance of Wireless Digital Communication System Corrupted by noise

In the following project, a digital communication system is developed where for modulation FSK ( Frequency Shift Keying ) is used.
BER vs different measurement parameters including Bit rate, Amplitude, Sampling Frequency and SNR graph is shown upon Simulation.

The project is coded on MATLAB
