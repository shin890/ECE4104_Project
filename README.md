# Project Name: Performance of Wireless Digital Communication System Corrupted by noise

In the following project, a digital communication system is developed where for modulation **FSK ( Frequency Shift Keying )** is used.
BER vs different measurement parameters including Bit rate, Amplitude, Sampling Frequency and SNR graph is shown upon Simulation.

This project is coded on MATLAB
